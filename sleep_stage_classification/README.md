# SleepStageClassification
Classification of sleep stages using accelerometer data

## 1. Preprocessing
This involves extracting necessary information from various accelerometer brands and storing them in specific standard formats for use with machine learning approaches.

## 2. Feature engineering
This approach involves extracting domain-related features deemed important by sleep / activity recognition researchers and using conventional machine learning techniques to classify sleep stages.

## 3. Deep learning
This approach involves extracting features from raw data extracted in Step 1 directly using the [McFly platform][1].
